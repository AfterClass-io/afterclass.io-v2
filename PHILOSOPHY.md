# Our Philosophy

✨ To build the best information hub used by students in schools, and ultimately
foster a strong community that encourages the preservation of high quality
information.

Taking heavy inspiration from the success of
[NUSMods](https://github.com/nusmodifications/nusmods/), we aim to build a
similar platform focused on Singapore Management University, with plans to
expand to other universities in Singapore.

As our users rely on accurate information available on our platform to make
informed, academic-focused decisions. We have a weighty obligation to keep our
users’ needs front and center in everything we do.

### 2. 💭 Think Wide; Plan Deep

We care about being right and it often takes reasoning from first principles to
get there.

### 3. ⏩ Quick Iterations

A bias for action speeds our learning and delights our users. Focus on what
matters most, make fast initial progress, and iterate toward the best outcome.

### 4. ✍🏼 Seek Feedback

We value intellectual honesty and look actively for ideas that refine our
thinking, challenge us, and deepen our understanding of our product.

### 5. 📜 Accountability

We take responsibility for our actions and decisions, ensuring that we follow
through on our commitments and deliver high-quality work. By owning our
outcomes, both positive and negative, we build trust within our team and with
our users. This dedication to accountability helps us maintain a culture of
reliability and integrity.

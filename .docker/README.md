# Dockerized Supabase

This directory closely mimics the Supabase setup for [self-hosting with Docker](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker). The `docker-compose.yml` file is a direct copy of the one found in the [Supabase github example](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/docker/docker-compose.yml)

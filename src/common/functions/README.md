# Common Functions

Each file in this folder exports a single function (matches filename) that can
be used in any module.

## When to add functions here?

If functions are used in more than 1 module.

If they are only used in 1 module for the foreseeable future, then put them
inside the `/modules/ModuleA/functions` folder

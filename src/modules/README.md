## Modules folder

If it is specific to a page, or it can't be used anywhere else in the project, use a module instead.

E.g. there could be an `auth` module that contains components, layouts and other files related to it, all in one folder and these files are not going to be referenced or used elsewhere.

### How to organise this folder

For each module e.g `/modules/auth`, you can mimic the folders created in `src/common` like having `/modules/auth/components` or `/modules/auth/functions`
